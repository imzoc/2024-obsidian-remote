(main) Types of science communication:
* Science entertainment like Bill Nye the Science Guy
* Science literacy like high school biology
* Science policy like... idk. Stuff lobbyists would use to convince politicians.
* Science opportunity like DIY guides
* Scientific funding like NSF grant proposals
* Self promotion like YouTube videos and personal webpages
* Field advancement, like scientific papers and articles.

Models for science communication
* Knowledge deficit model: informing people about evidence they weren't previously aware of (throw shit at the fan)
	* Assumes people don't know the evidence
	* Assumes people will know what to do with the evidence
* Low information rationality model: inform people about evidence they need to know in order to rationally make the decision or form the opinion you want them to.
	* Assumes the information is enough to rationally make the decision (maybe you need more!)
	* Assumes the information even supports or leads to the decision in the first place (maybe it's just completely wrong!)
* Contextual model: inform people about how evidence is significant and relevant to their life. 
	* Assumes the evidence is significant to their life, but they are unaware and need to be convinced. 
	* Assumes that they can do something with the evidence.

I *prefer* to view technical writing as different from regular writing because *your goals are different and your content is more specific*, rather than because it's written for a different audience.
