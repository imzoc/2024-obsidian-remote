* .34 grams of Hershey's cocoa [[PXL_20240820_184529232.jpg]]
* Tiny bit of cayenne [[PXL_20240820_184609638.jpg]]
* .07 grams of salt [[PXL_20240820_184653488.jpg]]
* .04 grams cinnamon [[PXL_20240820_184752419.jpg]]

## Extraction
I used 18 grams of beans (RSB 8/11/2024, from refridgerator) ground on 3. Extraction seemed good. I pulled 37 grams, I estimate 28 grams went into the latte. I used GV whole milk, probably 120 ish grams, hot but not blazing (i should use a thermometer!)

## Observations
The plain shot it was hard to tell much difference. 

The latte tastes different. it tastes a little earthy I think I can taste the chocolate. I can't taste the Salt but it has a little strange feeling in my mouth that might be the salt almost like I'm salivating a bit more. I don't notice any spice heat from the Cayenne and I don't taste the cinnamon directly.

Extracted at ~12:00. Indoor temp 80.4, indoor humidity 74%.
