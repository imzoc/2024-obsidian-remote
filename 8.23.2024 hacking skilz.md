tiny python

shebang at the top of python script, plus chmod +x, turns a python script into executable with python3!

ArgParser is useful for parsing command line arguments. Ken has a scaffold for it I think.

sys.argv is a list of all command-line arguments, including the current python file and its path run on the command line. running os.

os.path.dirname(sys.argv\[0]) gives the path of the python script relative to working directory.

remember that exit(0) gives no error and exit(1) or greater than 1 gives an error to the command line.
