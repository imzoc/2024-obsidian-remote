### August 12

Goals:

1. Replicate Sahlin's results.
2. Show the efficacy of strobemers as true edit distance increases.

To show Sahlin's results, it is best to write code that does what his code does. He generates NAMs.

This will show that my functions the same as his.

Then, my results will be sufficient in their own right.


I have two bags of objects, with hash values and indices.

I want to find all objects with matching hash values and return their indices.

Insert all SeedObjects into a HashMap, with seed hashes pointing to sets of seed indices

My first fully intentional log.

Today, I went into the lab and attended the machine learning reading group. We talked about parabolic "spaces", or dimensionality, or something. A parabolic manifold in a high dimensional space, which can be projected onto a space (plane?) of one less dimension. Cool stuff. Over my head.

I did a lot of small tasks today. My planner has all that info.

I talked to Travis about doing a PhD. He says a bunch of things. I should apply to a person, not a program, which makes sense. I want to look into NAU's faculty now, a better approach than just trying to get in.

I need to look at Sahlin's supplementary material. I can meet with Ken on Wednesday, but he warns me he might not be much help... I need to get strobemers done ASAP. I want to replicate Sahlin's results before I generate my own data, just to make sure my results are actually valid. Is that a good idea? The issue is I'm running into a wall with Sahlin's code because I can't read the damn thing.

That's basically all I think. I made Fajitas with mom which was a nice way to end the day.

Today, I want to review Sahlin's supplementary material because I think it contains the algorithm for finding NAMs. I am perplexed by his code; the function takes a ton of arguments. In total there are like 20 important objects to keep track of and it isn't documented in the code very well.

If I can't, I can always wait for Ken on Wednesday.

I understand what a NAM is, and Sahlin's description thereof. His description is a formal way of saying that NAMs are ordered sets (just think of them as collections) of strobemers that overlap on both the query and the reference sequence. They must overlap on the same end of the sequence.

NAM stands for "non-overlapping approximate match". Why is the word approximate in there? It seems to me that they are literally non-overlapping matches, no approximation involved. Strobemers are of course fuzzy/probabilistic seeds and are of course only *approximate representations of the actual string*, but the NAM itself is an exact match.

Perhaps Sahlin's not about Maximal Exact Matches may answer my question, although he doesn't describe them here.

So NAMs are not allowed to overlap with other NAMs... but a NAM itself is an *ordered set of overlapping strobemers*. A NAM spans \[r1, r2] on the reference sequence and \[q1, q2] on the query sequence, and the span of the NAM can't have an overlap with any other strobemer on both sequences.

I get that, mathematically. The issue is that Sahlin defines NAMs by defining what NAMs aren't. This sucks because I have to abstract what NAMs are, instead of Sahlin actually telling me what they are.

Well, I'll get back to NAMs. For now I can go through the Minstrobe, Randstrobe and Hybridstrobe algorithms I found in the supplementary material.

Time to wrap the day up. It's 19:36. I committed the work I did last time (I couldn't remember everything--a reminder to commit every time I finish working on code!). Tomorrow I want to make sure that Sahlin's algorithms are accurately reflected in my Rust implementation (I'm pretty sure they aren't right now). I still need to figure out what the heck NAMs are. I sent a message in Slack.

I think that's it. My work today is done.

I didn't do any strobemaxxing research today. It went well in other regards though.

I talked with Mark Martin about higher education, which was very interesting. He says that conferences are a great gateway into publishing, which seems like something I should look into.

On Pokemon Go community days, I really think it is more efficient to just take the streetcar instead of walking around lmao. It's a total cheat but I lowkey think it's just superior. I did it at the end of the community day and it went very well.

I forgot to take sugar with me, which didn't bite me in the ass but it could have. I have a source of very convenient, reusable, and cheap glucose so there is literally no excuse. Speaking of, I should buy more tubes (just did).

Copyq paste date doesn't seem to be working right now and I don't know why. Probably has to do with ZSA firmware.

Kristoffer's algorithm takes k as the length of the entire strobemer, and computes the length of each strobe from it. However, his code takes k as the length of each strobe and doesn't care about the length of the entire strobemer (his for loop accounts for it in other ways). My code should reflect the way he does it, so I will not calculate the strobemer span and instead find the strobe search window on the fly like he does.

Today was an overall unremarkable day. The only thing remarkable was setting up my desk with monitor, mouse and keyboard. Tbh I like low keyboards better and maybe I'll build one.

index.hpp has important struct info.

We need to find a way to print data structures, such as all_mers_vector.

installed ripgrep

Created makefile compile and run, and it works.

This is important because I can quickly edit c++ files to debug and run them.

I should focus on data structures (i.e. index.hpp)

The issue is these undocumented tuples.

I should create tests.

What am I doing now?

I am ditching NAMs. I am focusing solely on presenting my own data: graphs that show strobemer performance against true edit distance. Perhaps comparing them to

I made a lot of progress today. See git commit [126e1ac](https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/strobemers/commit/126e1ac99c015209cb03a73e4e5bd176ee2f67f2) for the deets.

I used sorted(glob.glob(pattern)) to create a sorted list of files matching pattern (for instance, pattern is /path/to/project/dir/data/query*.fasta). then, I can do os.path.basename(q) for each q in the sorted list of filename matches. It's quite great. I wonder if there's an easier way to do it, but honestly I think this gives me a nice balance between concision and fine-control.

Meeting with Travis

Finish up the strobemer data.
Ask John K. About 550.
Nail is fast and effective (why? He said something about heuristics... But for what?)
What do you learn in a data structures class?
