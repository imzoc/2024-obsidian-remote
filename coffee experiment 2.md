## Ingredients:
* .98 g cocoa
* .44 g salt
* .03g cayenne
* 1 g cinammon

## Extraction
Used .5 g of the blend in my espresso puck. I scattered the spices at two levels in the middle of the puck. I used 17.8 grams, (RSB 8/11/2024, from refridgerator),

I pulled 36.8 grams of espresso. It extracted nicely, but a little more erratic at the end, perhaps because of dissolved spices in the puck
## Iced latte

I used something like 160 grams of milk in the iced latte
## Hot latte

Hot milk was 158 degrees and I used 138 grams in the hot latte

## Observations

Both the hot latte and the cold latte taste notably different. I can taste earthiness for sure, probably from the cinnamon. I don't taste any heat. I also don't really have any extra salvation like I did in coffee experiment 1. When I looked in the spice mix it didn't seem like there was a lot of salt, even though the scale said there were .44 g... This experiment can't say anything about the salt then, because I'm not sure I used as much as I said I did.
