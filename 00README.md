# What is this?
Welcome to my 2024 node-based journal. It contains everything I want to remember for my own reference.

You can view the graph [here](https://2024-obsidian.vercel.app/).
# Why create a GitHub repository? 
* To keep a backup in the cloud
* To share my life with anyone interested--this is my social media :)

# How do I use this?
You can use the [web interface (with a pretty poor graph view)](https://2024-obsidian.vercel.app/) or [[clone this repository]] to your local machine and open it in Obsidian.

See [[Using internal links]]. Play around with graph view.
