# Overview
This node-based notebook uses [internal links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) for organization instead of folders. [Graph view](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view) gives a holistic overview of the notebook.

I date and sign content when I update it (usually entire nodes).

Try \[graph view of 2024-obsidian](TBD).

# Motivation
I hypothesize that using internal links and date/name notes for organization is compatible with arbitrary scale and asynchronous R&D. This repository, in this way, is sort of an [[experiments|experiment]].
