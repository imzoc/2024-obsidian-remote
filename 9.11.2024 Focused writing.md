[[Focused writing]]
### Wednesday.Sep.11.2024..20:20:10
I met with my advisor, Danny, and solidified my plan. I will graduate, assuming second semester proficency, in 2 semesters. I'm stressed about the second language proficiency. I also need to get CSC 585. Fucking need it.

Stress. Gotta do it. Get it done. Fast. Speedrun.

Food. I need to eat. Need to be able to eat when I get home. Can't rely on mom. Need to slow cook meals when I leave the house.

I thaw and marinate chicken in the PM. Toss in slow cooker in the AM. Eat in the PM and repeat.

Easy but daunting. No excuse. Gotta do it. People have it worse thannn me, I have no excuse. 

Focused writing. ESOC 302. Boring. Have to take it.

Talked with Bo. Meeting every month until I can do research with him. Read papers, run and maybe re-implement the programs.

Focused writing time is good. Stability. Routine. Get my thoughts out on paper. 

Lab photo shoot was fun. Lunch with labmates. Thoughts about dating life, market value, all that bullshit. I'm too focused on myself for that. It's not for me. Just gotta do me.

So many things to keep track of. I would die without my planner. It's so busy.

I stuck to my calendar today, 100%. Feels good to not justtt get good use out of it, but to actually have it reflect my life. and time commitments. Feels good.

Hopefully I don't fucking throw uppp again tonight. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck my body is praying on my downfall its' an opp.

My stomach in particular, doesn't like me.

I want to reach my potential. That's what it is.

I also really want to jack off right now.

5 minutes on the timer before I can   go to bed. It's 20:29.

OMG, apollon in the morning slaps so hard. It is genuinely so emotional. Remembering llllast semester is inspirational. The feeling, the grand canyon in the middle of it allllllll and despite it all, is the best. Raging sage shifts before and after. Insane, unstoppably good. I'm the best. No one can stop me. I'm taking hard classes and learning unlearnnnnnnnable things.

I think the world is going crazy. Tweakers and homelesssssssss people on the way home are getting worse, I think. Maybe it's just that I'm noticing it more. People that are geniunely out of their mind, acting in socially unapproachable ways. Unreaaaaaachable. Unacceptable and unsympathetic. How did they get there? Beyond reproach.

This lets me put my thoughts on paper like barf. I cccccccan explode however I want to. I don't need to delete the repeating characters because my keyboard is buggy. It's unimmmmmmmportant. all that matters is that I get my thoughts down because it wont be so in my head then. The less that lives inside my head,the better. The more that I can create and bring into this world to populate and conquer and reproduce and take over.
