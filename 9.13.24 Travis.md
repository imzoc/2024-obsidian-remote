Database search for local alignment
Largest amino acid-encoding DNA sequence is 65000 bp long

Strobemers, TSS, etc are about "there's a match somewhere in here"

Fuzzy probabilistic match, very cheap.

mmseqs is a little bit TOO selective: it throws away false negatives that hmmsearch doesn't!

Ken's suffix arrays used to recognize short, ungapped runs instead of mmseqs' full alignment from short ungapped 

Travis is confident that he knows where mmseqs throws away false negatives: two consecutive kmer runs on the same diagonal 

High recall is useless without high precision (too permissive)

mmseqs2 has high precision but lacks in recall (too aggressive)

alignment is essential for annotation, function, similarity, protein presence
