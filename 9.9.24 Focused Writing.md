I have a lot to talk about!

I will not press backspace unless to correct typos. I've been thinking a lot about research. I'm definitely getting better at reading papers, I think. I can make it to the end of a bioinformatics paper without my head spinning. It only takes me like 30 minutes to fully digest the main concepts of a paper, not including learning all of the algrithms they use which I'm not familiar with. 

I attended the bioinformatics reading group today. The speaker, Geneveive, presented slarn, or something. It's a cool paper with bad graphs, and an algorithm which I'd never heard of, like Hirschberg or something. The modifie the algorithm to do multi-something backward-pass in a dynamic programming matrix. 

I also did the UpGoer5 assignment today, pretty boring and makes me feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm feeling a kind of dread around my research because of the way that the ISTA class is structired. Maybe I should meet with my prof. 

I am feeling great about vector calc and quantum computing though.

I feel some general dread that I'm not doing enough research of my own. I'm a 3rd year student and I don't even have a paper or really any notable research to show for it. I made a Rust implementation which really is cool, but I'm not going to pursue it and it's a dead-end for Travis's purposes.

The thing I like most about right now, I think, is attending colloquiums and talks. I like hearing people with ideas. It's exctiting and enriching.

I'd love to pursue research in XAI with Bo Liu. Sounds very fun. I don't know if I'm good enough to do research thuogh.

I am starting to think that going into industry would be a good move, both for the money and also for the experience. I watched a material science video and my impression was that I would understand the motivations for oing this science a whole lot better if I knew why it was so important. I've just never seen the real world. The real world is a black box to me. I'm starting to see some of the mechanisms inside, but it's still pretty darn black.
