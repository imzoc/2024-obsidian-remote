Upload a Statement of Interest that describes your professional interests and goals. Because written language skills are crucial to the success of graduate education, pay careful attention to grammar, sentence structure, and appearance. Your statement also helps faculty evaluate how well your interests match those of the faculty member. Your Statement should be no more than 2 pages long (single spaced, 12-point font). Please ensure your name is on your document prior to uploading.

  

I am writing a statement of interest for the PhD in Informatics and computing. I am interested in this program for many reasons, which I will outline in the course of this statement. I will describe my academic background, accomplishments and interests, and my hopes for the future and why this program fits me well. I’ll give some personal background as well, and outline how I think I can contribute to the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems at NAU as a whole.

  

Please allow me to give a bit of background about myself. I enrolled as a computer science undergraduate student at the University of Arizona in the fall of 2022. I found myself unhappy with the presentation and expectations of the college. I felt it was too inflexible and didn’t give me the freedom to study what I was interested in. I wanted to explore the capabilities of technology, and I ended up in a major where I was being trained how to implement bubble sort with a pen and a paper (I’m not joking–the two final exams were entirely writing code with pen and paper!).

  

In the Spring of 2024, after 3 semesters of programming classes, I switched programs. I began studying at the college of information. I attended graduate classes in machine learning (INFO 521) and artificial intelligence (INFO 550), both of which I enjoyed immensely and performed phenomenally in. I did algorithms research under Dr. Travis Wheeler in the summer of 2024, culminating in an implementation of Kristoffer Sahlin’s Strobemer program in the Rust programming language. That summer research experience made me realize that I want to continue researching after I graduate. I absolutely love the research process.

  

I will complete my undergraduate studies at the University of Arizona in Spring of 2025, and I plan to continue researching in Travis Wheeler’s lab up until I graduate. But what should I do after I graduate? That's a question I constantly ask myself. I think doing a PhD would be a solid choice, and here's why.

  

In the future, I want to work at the forefront of emerging technology. I want to do inspiring things and work with inspiring people. I also want to diligently explore alternatives to my current research area (algorithms for bioinformatics) before I settle on it. If I knew for sure that I wanted to stay in bioinformatics, I would pursue a master's degree with my mentor, Travis Wheeler. However, I really want my first year or so to be an exploratory phase, where I familiarize myself with paradigms in a variety of fields. I don't want to commit to one area of research for all 5 years of my PhD. That's boring! I feel like I would be missing out on exposure to new ideas that may provide even better research opportunities, and even if they didn’t could really enrich my approach to the research process in general.

  

Why NAU? To be quite truthful, the strongest reason I want to attend NAU has nothing to do with academics. I love Flagstaff and I want to live in Flagstaff. It is my dream city. It’s close to the Grand Canyon, through which I routinely embark on multi-night backpacking trips with friends and relatives. It has amazing geography and nature in its own right. It’s close to Tucson, my home town, but it’s way cooler than Tucson. It has really cool architecture and my favorite cafe in the world (Macy’s). Now, with my guilty secret out of the way, let me explain how NAU’s PhD in informatics and computing is a great fit for me–and how getting accepted would be a dream come true.
