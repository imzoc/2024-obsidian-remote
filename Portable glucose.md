Purpose: Develop and produce convenient, easy and tasty glucose syrup for low blood sugar

Background

I want a convenient source of glucose. I want it to be cheap and use reusable materials. If I make it myself, I want it to be simple and easy to make.

Simple syrup in tubes.

Prototype 1.

I combined 200 mL of heated RO water with 120 grams of granulated sugar. It produced roughly 260 mL of sugar water. The sugar took a while to solve.

It tasted pretty bad while warm. Very, very sweet and a sharp aftertaste. It was not viscous when it was warm.

I stored ~50 mL in each of 3 tubes (total ~150 mL).

I stored about 50mL of the syrup with 4 drops of raspberry extract in the last test tube.
It tasted pretty good, even when warm.

I am storing them in the refridgerator, still warm

I did not record how they tasted when cold, although I vaguely remember liking them.

Prototype 2.

I combined 160 mL of room temperature RO water with 90 grams of granulated sugar, gave a little stir, and let sit for ~ 60 minutes.

The sugar wasn't dissolved after 60 minutes, there was a bunch of sugar granules that fell to the bottom and caked the bottom. After another stir and 3 minutes less was left, and after another stir and 10 minutes it's almost completely dissolved. Another stir and 10 minutes and it's completely dissolved.

~ 220 mL is produced. Adding 10 drops of raspberry extract makes it taste good. Completely filling 4 tubes leaves some spare. Each tube has probably exactly 50 mL capacity.

So this is way too sweet. Maybe use dextrose? Zach 9/24
