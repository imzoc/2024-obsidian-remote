[[ISTA 498H interviews]]
* Math and CS methods focused
* Most people do sequence stuff (DNA and proteins)
	* One level above that
* Use computers to better understand biology.
* Good to further explore biology
* Algorithms don't matter--all that matters is what it does!
* While testing, ask: what performance can we expect? What are the limits? 
* Find the best parameters for handling real data
* Benchmarking to show that the algorithm works and solves a problem.

* DNA has all the information we need
* Medicine questions and science questions
* Medical questions get funding
* Science questions, like phylogeny, are interesting but much less
* SRS: short-read sequencing results in lots of 300-bp sequences
* How do we reconstruct them?
* nail: Homology search tool
	* Posterior probability of similarity NOT because of chance
* Alignment tools
* Prior probability is important
* Any old sequence alignment technique doesn't have the priors to do what naill does.
* 60% AT 40% CG
* Tandem repeats abound--we don't want TSS to be sensittive to those.
* Transposable elements
* TSS paper test random sequences. Random sequences are very different from real sequences.
* There is no gold standard data set...
* Multiple datasets with different characteristics.

Because of unforseen priors, it's very hard to say what the limits of a method are. The limits are actually a lot farther than one would think.
