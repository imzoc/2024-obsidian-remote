[[Focused writing]]

Just an end of the day journal.

I'm excited by all of my classes. I want to do something for each class, each day, if I can, just to make sure I don't get behind. It will also force me to interleaf my studies.

I got my ipad pro today. It's big and thin and light, absolutely perfect. I can't wait to use it tomorrow. I need to figure out how to use it, though! Maybe I'll do that instead of going to campus early, and see what the parking situation is like if I get there a bit later than 6:30.

INFO 578 is great. ECE 540 is great. I will attend my capstone class tomorrow, as well as CSC 585: I have high hopes for both.

I have *not* finished my strobemers, and I worry that I wont. I need to get something out of them, at least.

Here are my thoughts. I'm currently working on getting my Rust method to automatically generate string similarity data for all query-reference pairs in a particular directory. I think that is valuable coding experience regardless of if it actually contributes to this particular project (although I think it absolutely will). Speaking of, I'll run a script overnight.

I am in no rush to get started with TSS, although I cannot say if I will be after class tomorrow. I think that ISTA 498 will be more focused on the process than the capstone itself, which I'm all for. I'm very happy to slow down the research and focus on the quality.

Vector calc is going to go well this semester. It's a 4-unit class, but I'm going to make it a 3- or 2-unit class because I'm simply built different. I'm going to work on it every day (or almost every--I didn't even work on it today, how can I say every day?!). It's very important to me, so I'll find time for it. Speaking of finding time.

I have a lot of unstructured time in the day. I need to make the most of it. I think I should actually structure that time. Maybe block off certain times for certain subjects, that way I make sure I do a little bit of everything every day. I think that would really benefit me overall.

I fucking hope I make it into CSC 585. Really hoping.

Now time to go to bed.
