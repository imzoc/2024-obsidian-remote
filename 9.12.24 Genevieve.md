Software development
sequence alignment
Translated search--genes in DNA by alignment directly to protein product
frame-shift awareness
amino acids are encoded with nucleotides
each 3mer of nucleotides are codons, maps to amino acid

benefit to alignment DNA to protein

many codons map to the same aminnnno acid... mostly differ in the last base of the codon

A change in a codon can happen without changing the amino acid.

Codon insertions or deletions cause a frame-shift,which often happens as a sequencing error (i.e. not actually in the DNA).

Gene duplication, one gene can get all fucked up without destroying the organism.

Much of our genome is "fossilized" transposable elements

Are there any applications of sequence alignment that you're particularly interested in?

Downsides of DNA - protein.

Splice-aware alignment.

Short vs long read sequencing

SRS
* cheaper
* higher per-base-pair accuracy

LRS
* Less "puzzle pieces" to put back together

Protein-DNA alignment can only be done when DNA encodes proteins.

Why is this important?
* Exponential growth of sequence databases.

We have the data to answer really interesting and impactful questions, but not the tools.
